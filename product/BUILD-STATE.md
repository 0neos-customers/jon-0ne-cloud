## TODO: Review Cron Schedules

Now on Vercel Pro, review all cron jobs and set optimal intervals:

| Cron | Current | Location | Notes |
|------|---------|----------|-------|
| sync-skool-dms | */5 * * * * | apps/web/vercel.json | Inbound DM sync |
| send-pending-dms | */5 * * * * | apps/web/vercel.json | Outbound DM send |
| hand-raiser-check | */15 * * * * | vercel.json | Auto-DM campaigns |
| sync-ghl | 0 4 * * * | apps/web/vercel.json | Daily GHL sync |
| sync-skool | 0 5 * * * | apps/web/vercel.json | Daily Skool sync |
| sync-meta | 0 6 * * * | apps/web/vercel.json | Daily Meta ads sync |
| aggregate | 0 7 * * * | apps/web/vercel.json | Daily aggregation |
